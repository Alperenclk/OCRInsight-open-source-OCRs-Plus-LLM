Gebze, Turkiye
 I developed identification system software for a bank using deep learning techniques. This system aimed to increase
security by optimizing customer authentication processes and was successfully implemented.
At a defense industry company, I managed the installation of industrial robots (ABB) on the production line. In this
project, I provided complex automation solutions to integrate robotic systems and increase operational efficiency.
For one of the leading telecom companies in Turkey, I developed software that enables live broadcasting and OTT
automation with Suitest software using Python and image processing techniques.
 For a beverage company, I was part of the team that developed an artificial intelligence application that checks the
recognition and accuracy of product labels on the production line.

Projects
Personalized Product Analysis with AI | Python, .Net, Huawei Cloud
Oct 2023
 Our application is designed to help users make informed and healthy choices when purchasing products. By uploading a
photo of the product's ingredients, the user can get a detailed analysis of how suitable and beneficial the product is for
them. The application scans the content of the product with artificial intelligence systems and identifies substances that
may cause allergies or adverse effects that the user has previously identified. It provides the user with a summary of the
product's content and the presence or absence of the substances they have identified. Thanks to this application, we
came 3rd in BTk Academy and Huawei Coding Marathon
Multi View Breast Cancer Classification App | Python, PyQt5, Deep learning
Apr 2022
 Within the scope of Teknofest artificial intelligence in health competition, the team I captained by developing a
multi-model deep learning network for the diagnosis of breast cancers succeeded in becoming a finalist.
Optical Character Recognition with Streamlit | Python, Streamlit, Huggingface
Jan 2024
 OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology has transformed how we interact with textual content in the digital
realm. By converting images, scanned documents, and other media into editable and searchable text, OCR enables us to
extract valuable information from diverse sources.

 Using advanced Computer Vision and deep learning techniques, I have developed a system that develops billboards that
provide personalized advertising by analyzing the characteristics of customers who come to stores in shopping malls. This
system works 15% more successfully than the foreign product previously used.
 Developed C# software using profile sensors from Sick and Venglor to control parts production for a Japan-based factory
With this software, we used advanced image processing techniques to process and analyze point cloud data to accurately
monitor the production process and detect defective parts, increasing the success rate of production to 95%.°

Projects
AI-Driven Cryptocurrency Trading Bot Python, LLM, LangChain, AI Agents
 Developed a cryptocurrency trading bot utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and LangChain to enhance trading
decisions. The bot integrates with the Binance API, executing trades based on real-time market data and technical
analysis.
 The LangChain framework and AI agents are used to analyze market trends by combining historical data with current
information. This setup enables the bot to perform detailed technical analysis and generate actionable insights for
trading.
 AI agents process news and social media to assess market sentiment. The bot adjusts its trading strategies based on
sentiment and technical indicators, aiming to maximize profitability and minimize risk.
 Python was used for developing the core functionalities and integrating the LangChain system, ensuring the bot's
efficiency and effectiveness in the volatile cryptocurrency market. The bot also adapts and improves its strategies over
time through continuous learning.
