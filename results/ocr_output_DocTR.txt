I developed dentification system software for a bank using deep learning techniques. This system aimed to increase
security by optimizing customer authentication processes and was successfully implemented.
At a defense industry company, I managed the installation of industrial robots (ABB) on the production line. In this
project, I provided complex automation solutions to integrate robotic: systems and increase operational efficiency-
For one of the leading telecom companies in Turkey, I developed software that enables live broadcasting and OTT
automation with Suitest software using Python and image processing techniques.
For a beverage company, I was part of the team that developed an artificial intelligence application that checks the
recognition and accuracy of product labels on the production line.

Personalized Product Analysis with AI Python, Net, Huatei Cloud
Oct 2023
Our application is designed to help users make informed and healthy choices when purchasing products. By uploading a
photo of the product's ingredients, the user can get a detailed analysis of how suitable and beneficial the product is for
them. The application scans the content of the product with artificial intelligence systems and identifies substances that
may cause allergies or adverse effects that the user has previously dentified. It provides the user with a summary of the
product's content and the presence or absence of the substances they have identified. Thanks to this application, we
came 3rd in BIk Academy and Huawei Coding Marathon
Multi View Breast Cancer Classification App - Python, PyQs, Deep learming
Apr 2022
Within the scope of Teknofest artificial intelligence in health competition, the team I captained by developing a
multi-model deep learning network for the diagnosis of breast cancers succeeded in becoming a finalist.
Optical Character Recognition with Streamlit I Python, Streamlit, Huggingface

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology has transformed how we interact with textual content in the digital
realm. By converting images, scanned documents, and other media into editable and searchable text, OCR enables us to
extract valuable information from diverse sources.
